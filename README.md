### 🚀 Overview
A **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** with an **intelligent content-serving system** that dynamically provides XML sitemaps to search engine bots while maintaining the normal PWA experience for human users.  
This architecture enhances **SEO performance** without compromising **user experience**.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 🧩 Core Components
- **Bottle.py Framework** – Lightweight Python web framework for backend routing  
- **User-Agent Detection** – Intelligent identification of search engine crawlers  
- **Dynamic Content Serving** – Conditional responses based on visitor type  
- **Sitemap Proxying** – Fetch and serve external sitemaps with caching and fallback  
- **SPA Routing** – Seamless client-side routing for the PWA  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Bot Detection
- Advanced pattern-based matching for bots like Googlebot, Bingbot, and others  
- Ensures correct content delivery for indexing

### 🔁 Dynamic Content Serving
| Visitor Type | Response |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Search Bots** | XML Sitemap content |
| **Human Users** | Full interactive PWA |
| **Static Assets** | Cached and efficiently served |

### 🌐 External Sitemap Integration
- Fetches XML from external sources dynamically  
- Caching and graceful fallbacks for reliability  

---

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### 🖥️ Server Configuration
- **Environment:** cPanel / CloudLinux  
- **WSGI Server:** Passenger for efficient Python serving  
- **Virtual Environment:** Isolated dependencies via `venv`  
- **.htaccess:** Handles URL rewriting, static file routing, and security rules  

### 🗺️ Routing System
Unified routing handles both user and bot requests using conditional logic for dynamic content delivery.

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 1️⃣ Create Directory in cPanel
- Go to **File Manager** → create folder `/bottle_app`

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
In cPanel **Terminal** or via **Python App setup**:
```bash
python3.9 -m venv ~/virtualenv/bottle_app/3.9
source ~/virtualenv/bottle_app/3.9/bin/activate
pip install bottle requests
3️⃣ Upload Application Files
Place your main app file (e.g. app.py) in /bottle_app.

Example structure:

swift
Copy code
/home/username/bottle_app/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── .htaccess
└── views/
4️⃣ Configure .htaccess
apache
Copy code
PassengerEnabled on
PassengerPython /home/username/virtualenv/bottle_app/3.9/bin/python
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /bottle_app/app.py/$1 [QSA,L]
5️⃣ Verify Deployment
Access your domain or subdomain.
If correctly configured, bots will receive the sitemap while normal users see the PWA.
